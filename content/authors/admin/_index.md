I'm Horacio Chacón-Torrico, MD and biomedical informatics researcher from Lima, Perú. I have worked in clinical records analytics and mHealth related projects. I'm actually doing secondary data research projects in public health and steadily learning more from the power of R and Data science tools.

This page will be a portfolio and notebook of all the knowledge I'll acquire in my R and Data science journey. You are welcome to join me.
